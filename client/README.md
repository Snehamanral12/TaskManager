# Task Manager - Full-Stack Application

Welcome to the Task Manager application, a secure and aesthetically pleasing full-stack project built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. This app allows authenticated users to manage their personal tasks, ensuring that data is private and secure.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* **Personalized Task Management**: Each user has their own private task list, accessible only after logging in.
* **CRUD Operations**: Users can create new tasks, view their existing tasks, update a task's status (completed/pending), and delete tasks.
* **Persistent Storage**: All user and task data is stored in a MongoDB database.
* **Modern UI**: A clean, responsive, and aesthetic user interface with a dark theme.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

**Frontend**:
* **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Hooks**: Used for state management and side effects.
* **CSS**: Custom styling for a modern and polished look.

**Backend**:
* **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
* **Express.js**: A fast and minimalist web framework for the backend API.
* **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user and task data.
* **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* **bcryptjs**: A library to hash passwords for secure storage.
* **jsonwebtoken**: Used for creating and verifying JWTs for user authentication.
